Subject: [PATCH 1/3] block/mirror: fix active mirror dead-lock in
 mirror_wait_on_conflicts

It's possible that requests start to wait each other in
mirror_wait_on_conflicts(). To avoid it let's use same technique as in
block/io.c in bdrv_wait_serialising_requests_locked() /
bdrv_find_conflicting_request(): don't wait on intersecting request if
it is already waiting for some other request.

For details of the dead-lock look at testIntersectingActiveIO()
test-case which we actually fixing now.
